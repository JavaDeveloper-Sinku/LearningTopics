## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **Java 8+**
* **IntelliJ IDEA** (Recommended)
* **JDK** for compilation
* **Git** for version control

---

## 💡 Learning Approach

* 🔍 **Code-first**: Every topic is explained via working Java code
* 🧪 **Test-driven**: Most programs include main methods to test immediately
* 📖 **Comment-rich**: Code includes inline comments to improve readability
* 🧱 **Modular design**: Each topic is structured in its own class/file

---

## 📈 Roadmap

* [x] Java Fundamentals
* [x] Data Structures (Array, Stack, LinkedList)
* [x] Logical Problems
* [ ] Advanced Collections
* [ ] Java 8 Features (Streams, Lambdas)
* [ ] Multithreading & Concurrency
* [ ] Basic Projects (e.g., ATM simulation, Library system)

## 🧪 Sample Programs

```java
// Example: Palindrome Check
public class Palindrome {
    public static boolean isPalindrome(String str) {
        int l = 0, r = str.length() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            if (str.charAt(l++) != str.charAt(r--)) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

```java
// Example: Find Duplicate in Array
public class DuplicateFinder {
    public static void findDuplicates(int[] arr) {
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (!seen.add(num)) System.out.println("Duplicate: " + num);
        }
    }
}
```
